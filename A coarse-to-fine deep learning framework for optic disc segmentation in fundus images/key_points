Optic Disk Segmentation

Steps:

 •Blood vessel extraction using method in [33]. Then calculate vessel density map. This is relevant the region around the optic disk has high
  blood vessel density. The density map show that there is a high intensity of vessels in the optic disk region. The paper states that diseases
  or abnormalities have little effect on characterisitics of the vessel density map.
  
 •The the RGB fundus image and the vessel density map is fed into a U-Net and two segmentation results are output.

 •These results susceptible to large segmentation errors.

 •The two above segmentation results were combined and their overlapped regions were identified. The largest overlapping region was chosen as reliable
  OD candidate. The region of overlap was then cropped out of the original RGB fundus image.

 •This cropped image patch is 3 times the diameter of the optic disk.

 •The identified circular image patches with three colour channels were then fed into the U-Net model again to perform refined segmentation.

 •They used a dataset they collected themselves from a hospital. The 7615 images were resized to 512x512. The images were manually processed by ophthalmologists 
  to annotate the disk regions.

 •The annotated ellipse regions were used as ground truths. The images were randomly divided into train, validation and test sets in the ratio of 0.75:0.15:0.1.

U-Net Architecture:

 •In each down convolution block, two 3x3 conv layers with batch normalisation and ReLU activation function. The conv blocks are then followed by a 2x2 max pooling
  layer with a stride of 2.  
 •In the decoding part, each block consists of a 2x2 upsampling layer and the same 2 3x3 conv layers followed by batch norm and ReLU.
 •Skip connections were used to concatenate the feature map from the encoding layer to the decoding layer.
 •The final decoded results fed into a 1x1 convolutional layer with sigmoid activation function to finalize target regions.
